I've been collecting various rocks for 20+ years and these "Enhydro Agates" are an exceptionally rare find. 
If you ever get a chance to hold one, hold it up close to your ear and shake it - a lot of them make pretty cool sounds due to the trapped water. 
They can also hold other substances inside of them such as soil/debris/carbon or even petroleum. 
This particular Enhydro Agate that OP posted is actually pretty famous in the rock collecting world having been discovered all the way back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.
